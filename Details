I help organizations build resilient and proactive security through the development of threat intelligence program strategies, and processes. I assist organizations to enhance timely proactive cyber defense through the incorporation of threat intelligence programs into their security operations (SecOps).

I track potential threats and actors that attempt intrusion into their source and malicious infrastructure using OSINT tools and HUMINT techniques.
